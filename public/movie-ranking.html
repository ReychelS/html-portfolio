<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>The note book</h3>
<p>This is my favorite movie. I love the beautiful love story. It is one of the fewest book adaptations that are better than the book itself</p>
<h3>Me Before You (2009)</h3>
<p>Beautiful and devastating at the same time.This unforgettable romantic tragedy introduces us to the witty Lou, who finally finds a job, this time as a caretaker.</p>
<h3>Letters to Juliet (2010)</h3>
<p>Amanda Seyfried is Sophie, a young girl on vacation in Italy who finds a “letter to Juliet”, 
    one of many letters left in a fictional Verona’s courtyard. She finds out that there is a group of women called
     “secretaries of Juliet” who answer 
    these letters and decides to join them and find out more about the relationships behind these words.</p>
